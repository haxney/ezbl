        URI to load at startup. Equivalent to `uzbl <uri>` or
        `set uri = URI` after `uzbl` has launched.

:verbose ANY-NON-NIL
        Whether to print all messages or just errors. Value is
        ignored as Uzbl does not accept a value for --verbose.

:name NAME
           Name of the current instance (defaults to Xorg window
           id or random for GtkSocket mode).

:config FILE
        Path to config file or `-` for stdin.

:socket SOCKET
        Xembed socket ID.

:connect-socket SOCKET
        Connect to server socket for event managing.

:print-events ANY-NON-NIL
        Whether to print events to stdout.

:geometry GEOMETRY
        Set window geometry (format: \"WIDTHxHEIGHT+-X+-Y\" or \"maximized\").

:display DISPLAY
        X display to use

:help ANY-NON-NIL
        Display help and exit.
